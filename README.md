See each directories for each keyboards in a table above.

## How to build

1. Check out this repository.

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball.git keyball
   ```

2. Check out [qmk/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/) repository in another place.

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules -b 0.22.3 qmk
   ```

   Currently Keyball firmwares are verified to compile with QMK 0.22.3

3. Create a symbolic link to this `keyball/` directory from [qmk/qmk_firmware]'s `keyboards/` directory.

   ```console
   $ ls
   keyball/ qmk/

   $ cd qmk/keyboards
   $ ln -s ../../keyball/qmk_firmware/keyboards/keyball keyball
   $ ls keyball/
   drivers/  keyball44/  lib/ã€€ readme.md
   $ cd ..
   ```

4. `make` your Keyball firmware.

   ```console

   # Build Keyball44 firmware with "default" keymap
   $ make SKIP_GIT=yes keyball/keyball44:default

   ```

There are three keymaps provided at least:

- `via` - Standard version with [Remap](https://remap-keys.app/) or VIA to change keymap
- `test` - Easy-to-use version for checking operation at build time
- `default` - Base version for creating your own customized firmware

## Easy Flash with Makefile

For convenience, this repository includes a `Makefile` that simplifies flashing your Keyball keyboard. The Makefile provides an easy way to flash different keymaps without typing the full QMK command each time.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have QMK installed and properly set up in `~/qmk` directory as described in the "How to build" section above.

### Usage

From the project root directory, you can use the following commands:

```console
# Flash with default keymap (nockoy_no_aml)
$ make flash

# Flash with a specific keymap
$ make flash KEYMAP=default
$ make flash KEYMAP=via
$ make flash KEYMAP=develop
$ make flash KEYMAP=takashicompany

# Show available commands and usage examples
$ make help
```

### Available Keymaps

You can use any keymap available in the `keyball44/keymaps/` directory:

- `default` - Base keymap
- `develop` - Development keymap
- `nockoy_aml` - Nockoy keymap with AML
- `nockoy_no_aml` - Nockoy keymap without AML (default)
- `takashicompany` - takashicompany's keymap
- `test` - Test keymap
- `via` - VIA-compatible keymap

### Customization

You can change the default keymap by editing the `KEYMAP` variable in the `Makefile`:

```makefile
KEYMAP ?= your_preferred_keymap
```
